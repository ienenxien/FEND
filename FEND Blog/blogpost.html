                    <p>Today is another day of quarrentine...of course, its not enforced quarrentine, but its sort of a universal absence of regular activity. I'm a theatrical sound designer, usually, and, of course, the entertainment industry was shuttered
                        awhile ago now. Which means I don't have work... so I'm doing this course in front end web development
                        <blockquote cite="me... every day of my life."> so that I can one day not hate the living daylights out of my website.</blockquote>
                        Of course, that presupposes that I get the freaking footer to show up in the right place on the index that I wrote.<br><br><br>... which is to say, hi. Nice to meet you.

                    <pitalics>root canal!</pitalics>
                    <p>Well most of one, during a global pandemic. Let me tell you, that was neither easy nor pleasant. Not that root canals are to begin with, but man, getting someone to actually let me pay them lots of money to hurt me was not easy in
                        the slightest. I called around for hours. Okay... an hour. Then I coded. Then I got my face drilled on and now I 'm still numb and coding some more. Global pandemic. Jiminy Cricket.
